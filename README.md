# Calendar App (Vite + React + TypeScript)

Small demo app that shows a calendar for the current month and lets you add/remove events (stored in `localStorage`).

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/amex/CodeBase/DockerNodeApp
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes
- Click the `+` on a day to add an event (simple prompt). Events persist in the browser's `localStorage` under the key `calendar-events-v1`.
